Basically ChatGPT was very pro abortion. She kept going on about how the decision really lies on the parents especially the woman who's carrying the child. I would say though her manner of delivery and her arguments were quite general. There weren't any specifics that she dove deeper into. She didn't cite any relevant cases in the Philippines. Nothing about rape was talked about. It was very introductory and a very safe stance on abortion. But then again I agree with what ChatGPT was saying.
