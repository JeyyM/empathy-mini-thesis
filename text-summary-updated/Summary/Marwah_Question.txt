It was mainly about protecting the dignity and value of the life of an unborn child while I was focusing on the one that's actually alive. So there's that. And despite me bringing up the immediate concern which is the reality that most women are facing right now and the damaged healthcare system the damaged society the very flawed society that has a very long time to go when it comes to fixing and reaching the goals that ChatGPT keeps on talking about when supporting their claims about anti-abortion. It doesn't really acknowledge it or it does but it doesn't respond to it and it felt lacking there from my perspective. It felt like that was a gap in our debate like it was mainly about the idealized goals mindsets. What they're striving for but it's never what we're currently facing right now. And yeah TLDR it was mainly theoretical on his end and practical for me.
