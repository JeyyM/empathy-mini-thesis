The main points ChatGPT had for this specific debate is that basically it understands that the death penalty shouldn't be applied as a whole. While I do agree with some of the points right but the death penalty should be reserved for the most heinous crimes like murder. In that sense for example it's a good question because you never know. What if someone innocent was being trialed or was being prosecuted? But it turns out just by human error or by accident they got the death penalty and so it would be irreversible. But it's kind of concerning even in that case. I'm sorry to say it but basically you can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs. Meaning someone might be accidentally prosecuted then that's that. And then they have to just work on making a better system. So yeah.
