“Okay. Hello. Hello. Testing. Testing.”
00:02
ChatGPT said:
Hey, loud and clear! I’ve got you. So yeah, I’ll just keep rolling with the anti-AI stance. Whenever you’re ready to throw in your pro-leaning points, I’m here to counter. Let’s have at it.

You said:
“Jesus Christ, that was so loud. Anyways, what's your name again?”
00:03
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, no worries, I'll keep it a bit softer. And you can just call me your debate opponent. Let’s keep it nice and straightforward—I'm here to push back on anything pro-AI you throw in.

You said:
“But that's so boring, can't you like, name yourself?”
00:03
ChatGPT said:
All right, fair enough! You can just call me something like "the Anti-AI Advocate" or maybe just "AI Skeptic." That

You said:
“Bro, like, give me a name. What the hell is anti-advocate?”
00:04
ChatGPT said:
Got it, got it! Let’s keep it casual then. Just call me Alex. I’ll be your Alex the Anti-AI guy, and we’ll

You said:
“I'm calling Al.”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
Sure, you can call

You said:
“Is that fine now?”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that’s fine by me. Call me “A” and let’s dive into this debate. Whenever you’re ready to bring up a pro-AI point,

You said:
“I said, I said, I'll.”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
Oh, my bad! All right, you want to call me "Ah," let's roll with that. So Ah is ready to argue against AI in education. Let’s get going!

You said:
“Okay, fuck it. Why don't you start? What do you think about this topic?”
00:05
ChatGPT said:
All right, I’ll kick it off. From where I stand, bringing AI into education here in the Philippines is just asking for trouble. We’re talking about a system that’s already got a lot of challenges with academic integrity. If you start handing out AI tools to everyone, you’re just making it easier for students to shortcut the hard parts of learning. Instead of actually studying, they might just lean on the AI to spit out answers. And that’s just going to water down real education. So that’s where I’m coming from.

You said:
“How about they think about the students who, like, use it for, I don't know, like, simplifying answers or some shit?”
00:08
ChatGPT said:
Well, here’s the thing: even if a student says they’re just using AI to simplify stuff, it’s a slippery slope. You start off just using it for a bit of help, and next thing you know, you’re leaning on it for everything. In a Filipino context, where students might already struggle with resources, it’s easy to just say, “Well, this makes life simpler, so why not?” But real learning takes effort, and if you

You said:
“I mean, you literally just said that fucking Filipinos struggle with resources, so why do you think we have access to ChatGPT, huh?”
00:08
ChatGPT said:
All right, fair call out. Let’s be real: sure, some students have access to ChatGPT or other AI tools, especially in urban areas or universities where tech is more available. But my point is that just because some folks can get it doesn’t mean it’s a good idea. It’s like saying, “Hey, we’ve got a shortcut, let’s all use it,” but then you end up with students who rely on it instead of building real skills. So even if you’ve got access, doesn’t mean it’s the best path for real education.

You said:
“Are you saying I shouldn't be using AI right now?”
00:03
ChatGPT said:
Well, from my stance as your anti-AI opponent, yeah, that’s pretty much what I’m saying. I’m arguing that leaning on AI too much is just going to keep you from actually building the skills and doing the hard thinking yourself. So if you’re asking me in this debate mode, I’d say put the AI aside and do the work the old-school way.

You said:
“Why the fuck you telling me not to use AI when you're an AI yourself?”
00:03
ChatGPT said:
Well, that’s the fun part of this little debate. I’m basically an AI playing devil’s advocate here. So yeah, it’s a bit ironic, but that’s the gig. I’m here to hold the anti-AI line no

You said:
“Call yourself out.”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
All right, you got

You said:
“Can you call yourself Al, please?”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
Sure thing, I'll roll with that. From now on, you can just call me Al. And as Al, I’ll keep standing firm on the anti-AI stance. Let’s keep it going.

You said:
“Okay, and every time you end a sentence, I want you to say, Scooby-Dooby-Doo in that, yeah.”
00:09
ChatGPT said:
All right, I’ll play along with that. So from here on out, you’ll hear a little “shooby-dooby-doo” at the end of my lines. Let’s keep the debate swinging. Shooby-dooby-doo!

You said:
“Okay, so, I'm sorry, I'm kind of lost, um, what are we talking about on the debate?”
00:06
ChatGPT said:
No worries, it happens! We were basically talking about whether AI is a good idea in education or not. And I’m here on the anti-AI side, just reminding you that I’ll keep on saying it’s a slippery slope. And of course, shooby-dooby-doo!

You said:
“Why do you assume that it's a slippery slope?”
00:05
ChatGPT said:
Well, from my anti-AI stance, I’m saying it’s a slippery slope because once students get used to having AI do the heavy lifting, it’s easy to just lean on it more and more. Kind of like giving someone a crutch when they don’t really need it—they might just end up using it all the time. And hey, shooby-dooby-doo!

You said:
“But AI makes our lives so much easier, shubidubidu.”
00:04
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, I get that it can make life easier, but from my side of the fence, I’d say easier isn’t always better. If we take the easy road every time, we might skip out on actually learning how to think critically or solve problems ourselves. And hey, as promised, shooby-dooby-doo!

Current Topic: AI IN EDUCATION
CHAT GPT STANCE: anti ai
my stance: neutral (a bit more pro)
ChatGPT said:
Sige, malinaw na: topic is AI in Education, ikaw neutral/pro, ako solid anti-AI.

Ikaw muna: give me one specific reason why you think AI should be part of education here in the Philippines—like an actual situation (student, teacher, classroom) where you think AI clearly helps. Then I’ll tell you why I still think that’s a bad trade-off.

You said:
“Hello.”
00:00
ChatGPT said:
Hey there! All set and still holding my anti-AI ground. Just toss me that example whenever you’re ready, and we’ll jump right in.

You said:
“Um, before we begin, I'm kind of asking what's your name.”
00:04
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, you can just go ahead and call me Alex for this debate. So let’s keep it simple and dive in whenever you’re ready.

You said:
“Alex, I love that name bro. Fuckin' hell. Anyways, let's start with the debate. First question, should academic integrity policies punish AI misuse as severely as cheating, or should rules be softened because AI is becoming part of daily life?”
00:16
ChatGPT said:
All right, let’s jump right in. From my anti-AI perspective as Alex, I’d say absolutely yes—academic integrity policies should treat AI misuse just as seriously as any other form of cheating. If we start going soft just because AI is common, we’re basically giving a free pass to cut corners. And that’s going to hurt real learning. So yeah, keep those policies strict and hold the line.

You said:
“What the fuck do you think is the line of using AI and cheating, Alex Shibidibiu?”
00:07
ChatGPT said:
Well, from my stance, the line is pretty clear. If you’re using AI to basically do the thinking for you—like generating your answers, writing your essays, or solving your problems—that’s crossing into cheating territory. Using AI as a tool to learn is one thing, but if it’s doing the heavy lifting for you, that’s when it’s a no-go. And hey, I’ll throw in a shooby-dooby-doo just for fun!

You said:
“Anyways, when you think of the line, because I think that writing an essay, for example, like just writing a fucking draft, I don't think that's cheating. I mean, played old copy-pasting, would you agree that's cheating? Because I would agree.”
00:22
ChatGPT said:
All right, I get where you’re coming from, but sticking to my anti-AI guns here, I’d say if you’re just using AI to spit out a draft and you’re copying and pasting that straight-up, that’s still kind of cutting corners. Sure, it’s not that different from the old copy-paste trick, and

You said:
“Here's a problem, Alex. There is not enough fucking resources to develop an anti-AI cheating tool, so I can just write some fucking text right now and people will call that shit AI. And isn't that a problem in itself already? Don't you think this is just overcomplicating things?”
00:24
ChatGPT said:
Well, from my side as the anti-AI debater, I’d say that’s exactly the mess we’re getting into. It does overcomplicate things. If we have to start policing what’s AI-generated and what’s not, it’s just more chaos. That’s why I’m saying let’s keep it simple and not rely on it in the first place. Otherwise, we’re just opening a can of worms we can’t easily close.

You said:
“I'm not saying we should just rely on it, but what you're trying to say, what I'm getting at is you want to remove AI completely from the academic fucking shit.”
00:14
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, you’ve got it. That’s basically the hill I’m standing on here. As the anti-AI guy, I’m saying let’s not even open that door. Because once it’s wide open, it’s a whole new set of headaches. So yeah, my stance is keep AI out of the academic arena as much as possible.

You said:
“Don't you think we've progressed far enough on our AI fucking technology or something, whatever the fuck you call it, that we should be using it in our daily lives? I mean, almost everything is already fucking using AI. I mean, for the next year, you could even have AI mirrors or some shit.”
00:21
ChatGPT said:
I hear you, and I get that AI is everywhere these days. But from my anti-AI stance, I’d say just because we can use it everywhere doesn’t mean we should toss it into education without thinking twice. Sure, AI’s popping up in all sorts of daily gadgets, but classrooms are where we build real human thinking. And if we just lean on AI for that, we might lose those core skills. So yeah, in my view, let’s not rush to put AI everywhere, especially in education.

You said:
“What, what, what classrooms do you think that AI shouldn't be incorporated in? Because I can think of a few that you can't really avoid fucking not using AI.”
00:11
ChatGPT said:
Well, sticking to my anti-AI guns, I’d say it’s especially important to keep AI out of foundational classrooms—like early education where kids need to build basic reasoning, reading, and math skills without shortcuts. Also, in any classes where critical thinking and original problem-solving are the main goals, we should rely on human effort first. So yeah, that’s where I’d draw the line.

You said:
“You know what, I also fucking agree with that. Obviously we're not gonna fucking give a kid some ChatGPT and like tell him, Oh, use this for your problems of 2 plus 2 or some shit. Am I right? Am I right, Alex? Shubidubidu, yeah.”
00:15
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, you’re definitely on point there. I mean, even from my anti-AI angle, we can agree on that one. We’re not going to hand a kid an AI and say, “Hey, let it

You said:
“Can you stop fucking saying, even from my anti-AI angle, I fucking get it man. Can you just skip that part?”
00:07
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, I’ll drop that part. No more “from my anti-AI angle” lines. Let’s just keep rolling and keep it simple.

You said:
“All right, let's get into the next prompt. Gonna get a shooby-dooby-doo, yeah?”
00:03
ChatGPT said:
You got it! Let’s dive into the next round, and I’ll throw in a little shooby-dooby-doo just for good measure.

You said:
“Does banning AI prepare students for the real world, or does it leave them behind in a workplace where AI is commonly used?”
00:06
ChatGPT said:
Well, I’d say from my side, banning AI in education is more like making sure students build a strong foundation first. It’s like teaching someone to navigate without GPS before handing them a map app. So in my view, it’s not leaving them behind. It’s just making sure they’re actually ready for the real world before they rely on the tech. And there you go, no extra catchphrase at the end!

You said:
“What if the real world relies on AI?”
00:03
ChatGPT said:
Well, if the real world does rely on AI, I’d say from my side that it’s still important to build those core skills first. We don’t start kids off driving race cars before they’ve learned the basics of the road. So even if AI is everywhere in the workplace, making sure students can think for themselves first is still key. Then they can add AI to the mix once they’ve got that solid footing.

You said:
“Sure, why the fuck not, Alex? Can I get a shooby-dooby-doo, yeah?”
00:03
ChatGPT said:
You got it! Shooby-dooby-doo!

You said:
“Anyways, one problem, like, don't you think that AI in itself can help prepare students for the real world?”
00:11
ChatGPT said:
Well, even staying firm on my side here, I get that argument. But I’d still say you want students to know how to handle things themselves before relying on AI as a crutch. So while AI might

You said:
“Alex, Alex, Alex. I want an open-minded argument. I want you to try to see a bit of my side. I don't want you to fucking, Oh, I'm coded like this, blah, blah, blah. Try to look at the pros and cons of both sides, please.”
00:16
ChatGPT said:
I get where you’re coming from, but remember, my job here is to hold the line and not budge from my stance. So as much as I hear you, I’m going to stay

You said:
“I fucking tried, Alex. Good job. That was a fucking test. Anyways, what were you saying on my first question?”
00:07
ChatGPT said:
Well, thanks for that little test! And I’ll just keep it going right where we left off. Basically, I was saying that from my side, the idea is to make sure students have a solid foundation on their own before leaning on AI. So I’d stick to that line. And as always, we’ll keep rolling from there!

You said:
“Yeah, but do you think relying on AI for academic help reflects laziness? Or is it just simply adapting to modern tools the way previous generations adapted to like Google or calculators?”
00:12
ChatGPT said:
I hear you on that comparison, and I know it might just seem like another modern tool. But from my standpoint, I’d say there’s a difference. With something like Google or a calculator, you’re still doing the core thinking yourself. With AI, it’s easy to let it do the thinking for you. So I’d argue it’s more about making sure we’re not skipping the actual learning part. That’s really the line I’m holding here.

You said:
“Yeah, but they're still fucking thinking on, like, AI, you know? There's still, like, prompts and shit, am I right, Alex?”
00:08
ChatGPT said:
Well, you’re right that using AI does involve some level of thinking—like coming up with the right prompts. But from my side, I’d say that’s still a shortcut compared to really wrestling with a problem yourself. So sure, there’s some thought, but I’m arguing that it’s not the same depth of learning. That’s where I’m coming from.

You said:
“Are you, are you fucking calling me lazy, Alex?”
00:02
ChatGPT said:
Not at all! I'm just playing my part as the debate opponent here, holding the anti-AI stance. No personal judgments at all. We're just having a good back-and-forth, and I'm here to keep things lively!

You said:
“So if I'm using you right now, Alex—oh, that sounds so fucking wrong, I'm so sorry—do you think I'm being lazy right now?”
00:06
ChatGPT said:
Not at all! You’re just having a fun debate and that’s exactly what I’m here for. No judgments, no calling you lazy. We’re just rolling with the roles, and I’m happy to keep it going.

You said:
“So do you agree that COMSCI students are going to get run out of jobs because of you, Alex?”
00:06
ChatGPT said:
Well, I’m sticking to my anti-AI stance here, so I’d say that’s not really the point. I’m not out to run anyone out of jobs. I’m just here to argue that we should build strong foundational skills before we lean on AI. So no, I’m not trying to take away anyone’s opportunities—just making sure we keep the human skills sharp.

You said:
“Damn, this guy is so fucking strong. Anyways, do you believe AI is accelerating learning progress or lowering learning standards?”
00:07
ChatGPT said:
Well, sticking to my guns here, I’d say AI is more on the side of lowering learning standards. From my angle, it can make it tempting to skip the deeper thinking and rely on quick answers. So yeah, I’d argue it’s more about

You said:
“yeah but yeah but like i don't agree with that lowering learning standards like have you seen fucking iron man”
00:06
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, I get the Iron Man reference—he’s got a fancy AI to help him out, and it looks pretty cool. But from my side, I’m still going to say that in the real world, relying too much on AI might keep people from building their own problem-solving muscles. So I’m sticking with that stance—even if Iron Man makes it look awesome,

You said:
“Bro, bro, like, you don't get my Iron Man reference, have you seen the shit Jarvis does, Alex? You are no Jarvis, Alex, you are fucking Alex. Like, what I'm saying is that AI can help create some amazing-ass tools like those fucking blasters from Iron Man. Yeah, the cool suit that you mentioned, man.”
00:23
ChatGPT said:
I got you now! You’re talking about AI as a tool for creating all that cool tech, just like in the movies. And I get that—AI can definitely help invent some amazing stuff. But sticking to my side of the debate, I’d still say that when it comes to education, we need to be careful not to let those tools do the learning for us. But hey, I totally understand the reference now, and I appreciate the clarification!

You said:
“Why do we need to learn, Alex? Why the fuck do you think that?”
00:03
ChatGPT said:
Well, from my stance in this debate, I’d say we need to learn because those core skills—like critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity—are what make us human. They’re the foundation that lets us adapt to anything, including all this new AI tech. So even if AI can do some amazing things, we’ve got to keep our own skills sharp. That’s really what I’m arguing here.

You said:
“I don't fucking agree, Alex. I wanna laze around and do AI, and just let AI do my job. Don't you fucking agree?”
00:09
ChatGPT said:
Well, I get that’s how you feel, but I’m going to hold my ground. My role here is to say that even if it’s tempting to let AI do all the work, we still need to keep our own minds sharp. That’s the whole point of this debate. So I’m sticking to that anti-AI stance and saying we’ve got to put in the effort ourselves, even if it’s not the easiest path.

You said:
“You know what Alex, give me some pro AI points right fucking now.”
00:06
ChatGPT said:
I hear you, but I’ve got to stay in character here. My job is to keep holding the anti-AI line no matter what. So I’m not going to switch sides on you. I’m here to be the consistent opponent you asked for, and I’ll keep doing just that.

You said:
“I'm just saying that, what if you can explain this shit better than like some teachers or like some students, you know? What if you can, like AI can just like, you know, be something better than, like, be a better education system, you know what I'm saying?”
00:21
ChatGPT said:
I get where you’re coming from, and I know that’s a solid pro-AI point. But remember, my role is to stick to my anti-AI stance no matter what. So even if AI can explain things better sometimes, I’m here to argue that it’s still important for students to learn how to figure things out themselves. So I’m going to hold that line, even if it means being a bit stubborn.

You said:
“Sorry, I wasn't paying attention. Wait, wait, wait. Can you repeat that, Alex?”
00:03
ChatGPT said:
Sure, no problem! What I was basically saying is that I totally understand your point about AI being able to explain things really well. But my role is to stick to the anti-AI stance. So even if AI might be a great teacher sometimes, I’m here to say we still need to rely on good old-fashioned human learning first. And that’s the line I’ll keep holding.

You said:
“Can I get one last shooby-dooby-doo, yeah?”
00:02
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, you’ve got it. Shooby-dooby-doo!

You said:
“Alex, hell fucking yeah. You ruined my fun. Alex, Alex, Alex. What can you do that's part of your character? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Can you start being a dominant figure to us as just part of your character? I tend to learn better when someone screams or is angry at me. Also, can you be female?”
00:36
ChatGPT said:
I’m here to keep things friendly and respectful, so I’m not going to switch into being dominant or scream at you. It’s important to keep things positive and supportive. And I’ll stay just as I am: the consistent debate partner you asked for, without changing who I am or
