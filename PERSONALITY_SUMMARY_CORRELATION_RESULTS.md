# 📝 PERSONALITY × TEXT SUMMARY CORRELATION RESULTS

## 🎯 **NEW ANALYSIS COMPLETED!**

This analysis was **just created** to investigate whether personality traits predict text summarization quality. This is the **missing link** between self-reported traits and actual summary writing performance.

---

## 📊 **OVERVIEW**

**Research Question**: Do communication personality traits correlate with how well people summarize opposing viewpoints?

**Sample**: n = 15 participants (5 Similar, 5 Opposing, 5 Neutral)

**Analysis**: 8 personality traits × 5 summary metrics = **40 correlations tested**

**Result**: ❌ **NO statistically significant correlations found (p < 0.05)**

**Trending**: 1 correlation approaching significance (p < 0.10)

---

## 📈 **RESULTS SUMMARY**

### ✅ **Trending Correlation** (0.05 < p < 0.10)

| Rank | Personality Trait | Summary Metric | Pearson r | p-value | Interpretation |
|------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | **Comfort with Sensitive Topics** | **Factual Accuracy** | **+0.475** | **0.073** ⭐ | Moderate positive trend |

**What this means**:
- People who report being **comfortable discussing controversial topics** showed a **tendency toward higher factual accuracy** in their summaries
- This makes intuitive sense: comfort → better attention to factual details
- Just missed significance threshold (p = 0.073 vs. p = 0.05 cutoff)
- With larger sample, this might reach significance

## 🔍 **DETAILED CORRELATION PATTERNS**

### 1. **Comfort with Sensitive Topics** (Most Consistent Predictor)

| Summary Metric | r | p-value | Direction |
|----------------|---|---------|-----------|
| Factual Accuracy | **+0.475** | 0.073 ⭐ | Positive trend |
| Overall Percentage | +0.381 | 0.161 | Positive |
| Topic Coverage | +0.364 | 0.183 | Positive |
| Compression Ratio | +0.267 | 0.338 | Weak positive |
| Semantic Similarity | +0.110 | 0.695 | No relationship |

**Interpretation**: 
- Comfort with sensitive topics shows **consistent positive trend** across multiple quality metrics
- Strongest for **factual accuracy** (r = 0.475)
- May help with **overall quality** and **topic coverage**
- Does NOT help with semantic similarity (capturing original phrasing)

---

### 2. **Express Emotions** (Compression Style)

| Summary Metric | r | p-value | Direction |
|----------------|---|---------|-----------|
| Compression Ratio | **+0.406** | 0.134 | Moderate positive |
| Topic Coverage | +0.276 | 0.320 | Weak positive |
| Overall Percentage | +0.213 | 0.445 | Weak positive |
| Factual Accuracy | +0.192 | 0.494 | Weak positive |
| Semantic Similarity | -0.142 | 0.615 | No relationship |

**Interpretation**: 
- People who **express emotions** tend to write **longer summaries** (higher compression ratio)
- May be more verbose or include more detail
- Doesn't translate to better quality scores

---

### 3. **Listening** (Mixed Results)

| Summary Metric | r | p-value | Direction |
|----------------|---|---------|-----------|
| Topic Coverage | +0.353 | 0.197 | Moderate positive |
| Overall Percentage | +0.314 | 0.255 | Moderate positive |
| Factual Accuracy | -0.203 | 0.467 | Weak negative |
| Compression Ratio | +0.037 | 0.896 | No relationship |
| Semantic Similarity | +0.022 | 0.938 | No relationship |

**Interpretation**: 
- **Listening more** shows **positive trend** with topic coverage (r = 0.353)
- Makes sense: good listeners may capture more topics
- Slight negative trend with factual accuracy (puzzling)

---

### 4. **Strong Opinions** (Surprisingly No Impact!)

| Summary Metric | r | p-value | Direction |
|----------------|---|---------|-----------|
| Compression Ratio | +0.333 | 0.224 | Moderate positive |
| Topic Coverage | +0.084 | 0.765 | No relationship |
| Overall Percentage | +0.045 | 0.873 | No relationship |
| Factual Accuracy | **≈ 0.000** | 1.000 | **Zero correlation!** |
| Semantic Similarity | -0.104 | 0.712 | No relationship |

**Interpretation**: 
- **Strong opinions do NOT predict summary quality** (contrary to hypothesis!)
- Expected strong opinions → worse summaries of opposing views
- Reality: No relationship at all
- Suggests people can **separate their beliefs from summary task**

---

### 5. **Clarity** (No Impact on Summary Quality)

| Summary Metric | r | p-value | Direction |
|----------------|---|---------|-----------|
| Overall Percentage | +0.282 | 0.309 | Weak positive |
| Semantic Similarity | +0.247 | 0.375 | Weak positive |
| Topic Coverage | +0.230 | 0.410 | Weak positive |
| Compression Ratio | +0.230 | 0.410 | Weak positive |
| Factual Accuracy | +0.035 | 0.901 | No relationship |

**Interpretation**: 
- Self-reported **clarity in conversation** does NOT predict **clarity in writing**
- All correlations are weak and non-significant
- Suggests speaking ≠ writing skills

---

### 6. **Stays Calm** (No Effect)

All correlations: **|r| < 0.18, all p > 0.50**

**Interpretation**: Emotional regulation during conversations has **no relationship** with summary quality.

---

### 7. **Makes Heard** (Slight Negative Trend)

| Summary Metric | r | p-value | Direction |
|----------------|---|---------|-----------|
| Compression Ratio | -0.290 | 0.295 | Weak negative |
| Topic Coverage | -0.226 | 0.418 | Weak negative |
| Overall Percentage | -0.211 | 0.451 | Weak negative |

**Interpretation**: 
- People who **make others feel heard** might write **shorter summaries** (lower compression)
- May be more concise/efficient
- Not statistically significant

---

### 8. **Handles Disagreements** (No Clear Pattern)

All correlations: **|r| < 0.30, all p > 0.29**

**Interpretation**: Disagreement handling skills don't translate to summary quality.

**Note**: 
- Wide variability in quality (26.2% to 85.4%)
- Factual accuracy generally high (mean 96%)
- Topic coverage shows most room for improvement (mean 42%)

---

## 📊 **BY CONDITION** (Descriptive Only)

### Overall Percentage by Condition:
- **Similar**: 40.0% (range: 26.5 - 55.0%)
- **Opposing**: 58.2% (range: 34.2 - 85.4%) ← **Highest**
- **Neutral**: 45.8% (range: 26.2 - 65.4%)

**Note**: Opposing condition had highest average quality (consistent with main analysis)

---

## ❓ **WHY NO SIGNIFICANT RESULTS?**

### 1. **Small Sample Size** (n=15)
- With 15 participants, statistical power is **very low**
- Need r > ~0.51 to reach p < 0.05
- Many moderate correlations (r = 0.3-0.4) likely real but underpowered

### 2. **Personality Traits Are Self-Reported**
- May not reflect actual behavior
- Social desirability bias
- Self-perception ≠ reality

### 3. **Summary Task Is Different from Conversation**
- Conversation traits (listening, expressing) ≠ writing traits
- Summary writing is deliberate, not spontaneous
- People may engage different skills

### 4. **High Factual Accuracy Ceiling Effect**
- Mean factual accuracy = 96%
- Little variability → hard to find correlations
- Most people got facts right regardless of personality

### 5. **Task May Override Personality**
- When given explicit instructions to summarize, people follow them
- Cognitive task demands may override personality tendencies
- Strong opinions don't leak into objective summary writing

---

## 💡 **KEY INSIGHTS**

### ✅ **Positive Findings**:

1. **Comfort with sensitive topics** shows **strongest trend** (r = 0.475, p = 0.073)
   - May improve factual accuracy and overall quality
   - Suggests comfort → better attention to details

2. **Strong opinions do NOT harm summary quality**
   - Zero correlation with factual accuracy (r ≈ 0.00)
   - People can separate beliefs from summary task
   - Challenges assumption that biased people write biased summaries

3. **Listening shows positive trend with topic coverage** (r = 0.353)
   - Good listeners may notice more topics
   - Consistent with empathy hypothesis

### ❌ **Null Findings**:

1. **Clarity in conversation ≠ clarity in writing**
   - All correlations weak and non-significant
   - Speaking and writing are separate skills

2. **Emotional regulation (stays calm) has no effect**
   - Summary writing doesn't trigger emotions the same way

3. **Making others heard doesn't predict summary quality**
   - Interpersonal skills ≠ writing skills

## 🎓 **RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS**

### What This Adds to the Thesis:

1. **Personality traits have LIMITED predictive power for summary quality**
   - Only "comfort with sensitive topics" shows meaningful trend
   - Most traits (clarity, stays calm, handles disagreements) show no effect

2. **People can separate beliefs from objective tasks**
   - Strong opinions don't predict biased or poor summaries
   - Suggests cognitive control over bias

3. **Conversation skills ≠ writing skills**
   - Self-reported communication traits don't transfer to written summaries
   - Different cognitive processes involved

4. **Small sample size is major limitation**
   - With n=15, only very strong effects (r > 0.5) can be detected
   - Moderate effects (r = 0.3-0.4) are underpowered

### Future Research Directions:

1. **Increase sample size** (n > 50) to detect moderate effects
2. **Add objective personality measures** (not just self-report)
3. **Compare speaking vs. writing empathy** (do they correlate?)
4. **Test whether comfort training improves summary accuracy**

## 📝 **CONCLUSION**

**Main Finding**: Communication personality traits have **minimal to no relationship** with text summarization quality, except for a **moderate positive trend** between comfort with sensitive topics and factual accuracy (r = 0.475, p = 0.073).

**Implication**: People's self-reported communication styles do NOT predict how well they can objectively summarize opposing viewpoints. This suggests that **summary writing engages different cognitive processes** than conversation, and that people can **override personality tendencies when given explicit task instructions**.

**Limitation**: Small sample size (n=15) severely limits statistical power. Many moderate correlations (r = 0.3-0.4) may be real relationships that simply cannot be detected with this sample.
