HOW CORRELATION WORKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Correlation Explanation:
------------------------

1. **Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r)**:
   - Measures LINEAR relationship between two variables
   - Range: -1 to +1
     * +1: Perfect positive linear relationship
     * -1: Perfect negative linear relationship
     *  0: No linear relationship
   - Interpretation:
     * |r| < 0.3: Weak correlation
     * 0.3 ≤ |r| < 0.5: Moderate correlation
     * 0.5 ≤ |r| < 0.7: Strong correlation
     * |r| ≥ 0.7: Very strong correlation

2. **Spearman Correlation Coefficient (ρ)**:
   - Measures MONOTONIC relationship (not necessarily linear)
   - Better for ordinal data (like Likert scales 1-5)
   - Robust to outliers
   - Same interpretation as Pearson

3. **P-value**:
   - Probability that the observed correlation occurred by chance
   - p < 0.05: Statistically significant (reject null hypothesis)
   - p < 0.01: Highly significant
   - p < 0.001: Very highly significant

4. **What This Analysis Shows**:
   - Which personality traits predict emotional responses during conversations
   - Whether certain traits lead to more positive/negative emotions
   - How communication style affects emotional arousal and intensity
   - Differences between Similar, Opposing, and Neutral viewpoint conditions

5. **Example Interpretation**:
   If "stays_calm × mean_stress" has r = -0.65, p = 0.001:
   - Strong negative correlation
   - People who report staying calm show LESS stress in conversations
   - This relationship is statistically significant
   - The pattern is consistent and unlikely due to chance

6. **Limitations**:
   - Correlation ≠ Causation
   - Small sample size may limit statistical power
   - Self-reported personality may differ from actual behavior
   - Context-dependent (specific to this study's conversation topics)
