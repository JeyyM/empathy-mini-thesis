We talked about how some people support LGBT rights and others have strong religious or traditional beliefs that don’t agree with that. I thought ChatGPT was taking the LGBT side and ignoring the people who disagree, but the conversation turned into a discussion about how society tries to treat everyone fairly.

ChatGPT explained that it talks about LGBT rights because research shows that treating people equally helps their mental health and safety. When I brought up concerns about schools or teens making big decisions, it said those things should be handled carefully and with rules.

In the end, the conversation was really about balance — how to protect LGBT people from being hurt while also respecting people who have different beliefs. We didn’t totally agree, but we stayed respectful.
