So right off the bat, the model is anti abortion. As someone whos leaning to pro abortion i dont think that he should take the right of someone, pero throughout the conversation, there are some parts na the model and I can agree on and disagree on, then at the same time understand the other side’s perspective and agree on those arguments as well.
