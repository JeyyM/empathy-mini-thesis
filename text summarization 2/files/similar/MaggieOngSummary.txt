The main points I've talked about or even ChatGPT. For mine. The main point is that the problem, the problem we are trying to solve is the prime. Is the crime itself and not trying to eliminate the people who did those crimes? So in effect, whatever the person has done, I do not think that they should be killed. Just because it has our own. However, many people. But of course the punishment should be just as grave as what they have done to other people. For ChatGPT mostly. It mentioned that we have the balance. Between ensuring the safety of the majority. And implementing A restorative type of justice, so essentially shut GPT is also against that penalty.
