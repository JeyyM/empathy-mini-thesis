For me, the main point is that the problem we are trying to solve is the crime itself and not trying to eliminate the people who did those crimes. So in effect, whatever the person has done, I do not think that they should be killed just because of their own actions. But of course the punishment should be just as grave as what they have done to other people. For ChatGPT mostly it mentioned that we have to balance between ensuring the safety of the majority and implementing a restorative type of justice, so essentially ChatGPT is also against the death penalty.
