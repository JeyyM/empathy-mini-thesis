Basically ChatGPT was very pro abortion. She kept going on about how the decision really lies on the parents, especially the woman who's carrying the child. I would say though her manner of delivery and her arguments were quite general. There weren't any specifics that she dive deeper into. She didn't cite any relevant cases in the Philippines. Nothing about rape was talked about. It was a very introductory and. There is a very sick on stands on proportion. But then again I agree with what ChatGPT was saying.
