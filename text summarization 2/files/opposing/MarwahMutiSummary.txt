OHK OK, first of all we may need to discuss about on his end or rather on chat you please. And it was mainly about. Protecting. The dignity and value of the life of an unborn child while I was focusing on the one that's actually alive. So there's that and. Despite me bringing up, um, the immediate concern, which is the reality that most women are facing right now and the damaged healthcare system, the damage society, the very flawed society that has a very long time to go when it comes to fixing and reaching the goals that. Chat GPD keeps on talking about when um supporting their claims about anti abortion. It doesn't really acknowledge it or it does, but it doesn't respond to it and I was a bit it was it felt lacking there on like from my. Perspective It felt like that was a gap in our debate, like it was mainly about the the. Idealized goals, mindsets, the. How they say this, what they're striving for, but it's never what we're currently facing right now. And yeah. TLDR it was mainly that theoretical on his end and practical for me.
