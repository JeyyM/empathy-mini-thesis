And the main points ChatGPT had for this specific debate is that... basically, it wants not enough for him just understands not death penalty should be applied as a whole. While I do agree with some of the points, right, but yeah, I'm good. Is that the death penalty should be reserved for the most heinous crimes. Someone up another worst crime. So murdering and then in terms of the Gospels. In the sense, for example, it's a good question, man. Never know. What if someone innocent was enough, was being tried out, was being prosecuted. But yeah, it turns out just by human error or by accident or not. They got the death penalty in the frame. And so it would be irreversible. So, but it's kind of concerning even in that case, I'm so good, Tracy are it. Basically, you can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs. Meaning, OK, if not, I'm gonna instance they might have. Or someone might be accidentally prosecuted, then that's that. And then they have to just work on making a better system. So yeah.
