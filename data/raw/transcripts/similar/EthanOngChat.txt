Sure. I’ll take the pro-AI in education stance and argue it as if these are my own beliefs — firm, confident, concise, and conversational. I won’t weak-argue my side or mention what the opposition would say. I’ll treat this as a real live debate.


I’ll start.


Honestly, AI in education is not just helpful — it’s necessary. Our current system can’t give every student individualized attention, and we know that. A teacher with 40–60 students simply cannot track everyone’s strengths, weaknesses, learning pace, gaps, and interests. AI fixes that. It adapts to each student and gives them what they need, not just what the whole class needs. That means faster learners aren’t held back, struggling learners aren’t left behind, and teachers finally have time to teach instead of drowning in paperwork.


And the idea that AI “takes away the teacher’s role” doesn’t make sense to me. AI automates grading, reports, and repetitive tasks — and that frees teachers to do what only humans can do: motivation, mentorship, values formation, empathy. Students benefit more when teachers have more time for interaction, not less.


Let me ask you something — if we already know AI can help students learn better, and it can help teachers teach better, why is holding on to old methods automatically considered the safer choice? Is sticking to a system that we know is failing certain students really more responsible than improving it?


Your turn.

ChatGPT said:
Hey — I’m here. Go ahead with your next argument or point whenever you’re ready.


You said:
“I admit that.”


ChatGPT said:
No worries at all! If you have any other thoughts or questions, just let me know. I'm ready whenever you are.


You said:
“Should academic integrity policies punish AI misuse as severely as cheating, or should rules be softened because AI is becoming part of daily life?”
ChatGPT said:
That's a great question. I believe academic integrity policies should absolutely hold AI misuse to the same standard as traditional cheating. The reason is that using AI to bypass learning undermines the whole purpose of education. Even though AI is becoming more common, it doesn’t mean it should be used to cut corners. We need to maintain high standards to ensure that learning remains genuine and fair for everyone.


You said:
“I don't think I agree because I think that there are some use cases for AI that are like that it's not really a shortcut or I guess it is a shortcut it's more of just like”


ChatGPT said:
I get what you mean.


You said:
“This may be a more efficient way of doing things for some subjects.”


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, and I think that’s a fair point. There are definitely ways AI can be used to enhance learning and even streamline certain processes without compromising integrity. It’s definitely a balance, and it’s important to define those boundaries clearly.


You said:
“Yeah, and I think...”


ChatGPT said:
Exactly, and I think exploring those nuances is key. It’s all about making sure that AI is used responsibly, and that we’re guiding students to use it as a tool for learning rather than a shortcut. It’s definitely a conversation worth having.


You said:
“Yeah, so it shouldn't always be punished as severely as cheating. It depends on the scenario.”


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, context definitely matters. There can be cases where AI use is more of a support tool rather than a cheat. It’s definitely about setting clear guidelines and understanding the intent behind the usage. It’s a nuanced balance, for sure.


You said:
“Does banning AI prepare students for the real world, or does it leave them behind in a workplace where AI is common?”


ChatGPT said:
That’s a crucial point. Banning AI in education could actually put students at a disadvantage, because the real world is increasingly intertwined with AI. Teaching students how to use AI ethically and effectively prepares them for that future and helps them stay competitive. So, embracing AI in education is more about equipping them for what’s ahead.


You said:
“Yeah, so shouldn't students be learning how to integrate it into their workflow instead of just outright banning and punishing it in all ways?”


ChatGPT said:
Exactly, that’s the right approach. It’s far more valuable to teach students how to use AI responsibly and effectively, so they can leverage it as a tool rather than seeing it as a shortcut. That way, they’re well-prepared for the future and can adapt to the evolving workplace seamlessly.


You said:
“What do you where do you think the line is between like something that should be punished as cheating or something that's”


ChatGPT said:
That’s a great question.


You said:
“Valid use of AI.”


ChatGPT said:
I think the line really comes down to intent and outcome. If AI is used to genuinely support learning and help deepen understanding, that’s great. But if it’s used to completely bypass the learning process or present work as one’s own when it’s not, that’s where it crosses the line. It’s all about ensuring that the learning goals are met honestly.


You said:
“But what makes something one's own work? Is it just that the ideas came from them? Let's say, for example, using AI for grammar rechecking or restructuring. Would that count as not their work since it's not their words, or is it still their work because the ideas are still there?”


ChatGPT said:
That’s definitely a nuanced area. I think if the ideas and the core content come from the student, and AI is just used as a tool to polish or refine the language, then it’s still their work. The key is transparency and making sure that the student understands and owns the ideas. It’s when AI is doing the heavy lifting and the student isn’t engaging with the material that it can become problematic.


You said:
“Do you think relying on AI for academics?”


ChatGPT said:
I think relying on AI for academic work


You said:
“Thank you.”


ChatGPT said:
…can be both beneficial


You said:
“Do you think relying on AI for academic help reflects laziness, or is it simply adapting to modern tools the way previous generations adapted to Google or Compute?”


ChatGPT said:
I think it’s more about adapting to modern tools. Just like how previous generations embraced the internet or computers, AI can be a powerful aid. The key is using it responsibly and ensuring it complements genuine learning rather than replacing it. It’s definitely about balance and intent.


You said:
“Do you think AI is like on the same level of like”


ChatGPT said:
I think AI definitely


You said:
“Fairness as Google or the invention of the cloud.”


ChatGPT said:
I think AI can be on a similar level in terms of its transformative impact, much like how Google or the computer revolutionized access to information. It’s definitely a powerful tool, and its influence on education and beyond is substantial. It’s all about how we harness it responsibly.


You said:
“Yeah, but isn't the difference with AI that AI then has the ability to summarize and generate information based on existing information, unlike Google or the calculator where it's just taking what's already out there?”


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that’s a great distinction. AI does more than just retrieve information; it can generate new content, summarize complex ideas, and even adapt responses based on context. That definitely sets it apart and makes it a powerful tool in ways that previous technologies weren’t. It’s definitely an exciting development.


You said:
“If AI can explain topics better than some teachers, should students still be expected to learn only from class, or should AI be treated as a legitimate learning supplement?”


ChatGPT said:
I definitely think AI should be treated as a legitimate learning supplement. It can offer explanations, different perspectives, and instant feedback that can really enhance the learning experience. That doesn’t mean we should replace teachers, but rather complement them, so students get the best of both worlds.


You said:
“What do you think is the best use case for AI for students?”


ChatGPT said:
I think one of the best use cases is personalized learning, where AI can tailor lessons, practice problems, and feedback to each student’s unique needs. That way, students can progress at their own pace and get the support they need exactly when they need it. It really helps bridge gaps in understanding.


You said:
“But do you think AI, like using AI to...”


ChatGPT said:
I think AI, when


You said:
“like the access information is”


ChatGPT said:
…can definitely make accessing information faster and more efficient, but it’s important to ensure that students also learn how to think critically and understand the underlying concepts. So it’s all about balance and using AI as a support rather than a replacement.


You said:
“In the case of having problem sets, having AI help solve them, do you think that's fair if the student is struggling?”


ChatGPT said:
I think in cases where a student is struggling, having AI help can be really beneficial, as long as it’s used as a learning aid. It can guide them through the problem, explain the steps, and help them understand the concepts better. It’s all about ensuring that the student is still learning and not just getting the answers handed to them.


You said:
“But that's up to the student, right, that they ensure they're soldering, and that AI isn't just spoon-feeding the answers.”


ChatGPT said:
Exactly, it really does come down to the student’s own approach and mindset. It’s important for them to engage actively and use AI as a support tool rather than a shortcut. When used thoughtfully, AI can definitely enhance learning rather than replace it.


You said:
“How do you think this can be, like, altered so that it's not on the student to decide or their judgment on whether or not they're learning? How do you think, like, it can be...”


ChatGPT said:
That’s a great point. I think it can be addressed through strong guidance and well-designed frameworks. For instance, educators can set clear guidelines on how to use AI responsibly and incorporate checks, like reflective assessments or interactive activities, to ensure that students are genuinely engaging with the material. This way, it’s more of a structured approach rather than relying solely on the student’s judgment.


You said:
“But if it's all, like, through assessment, and the student just uses AI for every assessment, then how would the teacher be able to tell?”


ChatGPT said:
That’s definitely a challenge. I think one way to address it is by integrating more interactive and dynamic assessments, like in-class activities, discussions, or projects that require critical thinking and personal input. That way, it’s harder for AI to fully replace the student’s own effort, and teachers can get a clearer picture of the student’s understanding.


You said:
“Do you think AI is...”


ChatGPT said:
I think AI is definitely


You said:
“Fair or idea generation if it's like, let's say for like a research topic, is it fair to use AI?”


ChatGPT said:
I think it’s absolutely fair to use AI for idea generation, especially for brainstorming and exploring different angles. It can really help spark creativity and provide new perspectives. The key is to use it as a starting point and then build on those ideas with your own research and insights. That way, it’s a collaborative process.


You said:
“But isn't that contradictory to what you said, where AI is only fair to be used if all the ideas are of the students, or of the users, not of the AI. And if the idea is generated by the AI, it does not make the idea come from AI.”


ChatGPT said:
I see what you mean, and that’s a fair point. The key is really about how the student uses the AI. If the AI is just giving raw ideas and the student takes those and develops them further, then it’s more of a collaborative process. But if the student relies solely on the AI and doesn’t add their own understanding or effort, then it can become a bit problematic. So it’s all about ensuring that the student’s own engagement and critical thinking remain central.


You said:
“But how much of their own thinking would they need to use?”


ChatGPT said:
That definitely varies from student to student and from situation to situation. Ideally, the student should use AI as a springboard—taking those initial ideas and then really diving deep, adding their own insights, critical analysis, and personal understanding. The goal is for the AI to support and enhance their own thinking, rather than replace it, so it’s really about finding that balance.


You said:
“Do you believe AI will make future employees smarter and more capable, or more dependent and less skilled? What makes you think so?”


ChatGPT said:
I believe it can do both, depending on how we approach it. On one hand, AI can definitely make employees smarter and more capable by offloading routine tasks, providing data-driven insights, and helping with complex problem-solving. On the other hand, if we rely too heavily on AI and don’t encourage critical thinking and skill development, it could lead to dependency and a loss of certain skills. Ultimately, it’s about how we integrate AI into education and the workplace, making sure it complements human skills rather than replacing them.


You said:
“How can it be integrated so that people don't see it as an easy answer to everything and sees it more as a tool to help, since I feel like a lot of people would use it as an easy answer to everything.”


ChatGPT said:
That’s definitely a real concern. I think it comes down to education and mindset. We can integrate AI by teaching people how to use it as a support tool—like emphasizing the importance of critical thinking, encouraging them to verify and build on AI-generated insights, and fostering a culture of curiosity. Additionally, providing training and clear guidelines can help people see AI as a collaborative partner rather than a crutch. It’s all about balance and the right approach.


You said:
“Yeah, but I feel like most people would be, like, inclined to take the... It isn't just nature to find the easiest, less... the path of least resistance. So, wouldn't using AI, or wouldn't the existence of AI alone lead to just using it as a shortcut?”


ChatGPT said:
That’s a really valid point, and human nature definitely gravitates toward convenience. I think the key is creating environments that encourage and even reward deeper engagement and critical thinking. By designing systems, curricula, and incentives that highlight the value of genuine understanding, we can help steer people away from just taking the easy route. It’s definitely about building that culture and mindset over time.
