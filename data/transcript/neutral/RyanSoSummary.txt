So the main points I discussed with ChatGPT were the death penalty, the pros and cons and the advantages and disadvantages of keeping it and abolishing it.

The main points for keeping it is it provides a sense of justice, a sense of closure for families so that they can see in cases like murder or someone taking someone's life away, they can see that their loved ones' closure is also gone now. And massively deter someone from doing any serious crime. Now it also said that as a form of retribution, we have to be careful because it might be used as retribution for others that might be used in the wrong way so it's a very sensitive topic, that needed to be handled carefully

Not for the points against, there were mentions of wrongful convictions, also the fact that there are alternative punishments to the death penalty, we don't always need to resort to death. And the general argument is that the death penalty is not entirely needed and can be substituted, and that's also an old practice.
