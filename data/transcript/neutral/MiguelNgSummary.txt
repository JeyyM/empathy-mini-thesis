I remember talking to ChatGPT about what if we consider the situation of rape, so for instance when the mother has been raped, should the child be delivered or not. I also mentioned the Philippine context wherein a lot of Filipinos are poor, so should the baby be born or not. I also mentioned the health of the mom, should we prioritize the mom or the baby? And I also gave a lot of questions, a lot of hypotheticals like the one toddler or the hundred embryos.
