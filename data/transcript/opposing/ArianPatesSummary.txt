It seemed like the AI really hates AI, or maybe it was just prompted to be against it,which is ironic since it is an AI. It kept telling me how to implement things specifically in the Philippines, which I didn't get because I thought we were discussing this on a global scale. That’s why I mentioned Finland, since their system works well. The AI kept pointing out that it's a shortcut. Yeah, it is a shortcut, but that’s exactly why we invent stuff. That's the whole point. We just have to use it correctly because not everyone needs to be giga smart.
